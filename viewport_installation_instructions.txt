How to setup/install your Viewport framework:

1. Use the image templates to create slides of your work. The templates are sized 768px x 1026px at 132 dpi. Viewport can be set up in either portrait OR landscape orientations and can handle any common web image format, including .png, .jpg, or .gif. 

2. Open the index.html file provided in the editor of your choice and add your slide locations into the appropriate <img> tags. (We've commented the markup to help, "add your slide location here")

3. Adjust the "#pageflip" and ".scroller" dimensions within the "Customized CSS" section of the index.html file to compensate the width and height of your pages and slides. Save your index.html file.

* This step applies to the offline cache feature. *
4. Open the viewport.manifest file and add the location of your slides where it says "# Edit these paths to YOUR slide locations". Save your viewport.manifest file.  

5. Upload the index.html, your slides, and viewport.manifest to your hosted web space within the same directory.  

6. Open your iPad's browser, point it to the address of your viewport framework index.html file, and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your iPad.
* There is a video of this step located

*Due to some web hosting setups you may have to use the included .htaccess file to allow for offline viewing. If necessary, upload the "add_to_root.htaccess" file to your web space root directory, and rename it ".htaccess".  This creates a file that may become hidden due to your settings. What this file does is allow your server to accept the manifest file type and use it for offline cache. 

We hope you enjoy Viewport. We've tried to make the setup as simple as possible. However, if you have any questions or issues you can post them at http://getsatisfaction.com/gruntmonkey_llc.
